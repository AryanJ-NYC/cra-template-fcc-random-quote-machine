# Create React App Template: freeCodeCamp Random Quote Machine

This project is a starter template for future developers learning to code using the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. Specifically, this starter template is a test suite for the [Random Quote Machine project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).

## Motivation

freeCodeCamp is one of the best spaces out there for aspiring web developers to learn how to develop for the web. Its projects are its main strength as project-based learning is the best way forward.

However, I think there is a better way to approach these projects rather than suggesting it all be done on CodePen. The jump from browser-based code editors to local text editors is a big one. I hope this tool will provide an easy way for that transition to happen.

## Install Create React App using this Template

```bash
 npx create-react-app random-quote-machine --template cra-template-fcc-random-quote-machine
```

or

```bash
yarn create react-app random-quote-machine --template cra-template-fcc-random-quote-machine
```
