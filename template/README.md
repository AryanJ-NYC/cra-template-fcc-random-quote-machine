# Random Quote Machine

This template is meant to make it easier for you to develop the Random Quote Machine on your local computer. If you're reading this, you probably already made a copy of the provided template.

## Getting Started

### Running your Local Development Server

You'll want to start your local (local as in on your machine) development (this is the server you'll use to develop your app) server. To do so, in your command line, run:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Now go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your local app running.

### Change Some Code

Obviously, you'll want to change the code as you create your Random Quote Machine. You'll want to edit the React code in `/src/App.js` to do so.

### Run Tests Locally

I've written helper tests (that match those created by freeCodeCamp) to help you as you code. In a separate command line tab or window, run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

or

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

With your tests running, continue coding and try to get all the tests to pass!
